Final Project Proposal

For my project I intend to implement a todo list app that makes a long 
list of things to do simple by showing you only the next thing that you 
have to do. On the Task view you can either complete or skip a task. 
Skipping a task simply puts it after the next item to do in the list. 
You can choose to have a due date displayed under the task as well as
the current weather if you want to view conditions at a glance. There will
be a list view as well that allows you to edit tasks and reorder the list
to show present you in the order you want to do things in. To view different
lists swiping left or right through the TodoLists while in task view will
accomplish this.

Using Core Data entities will be a TodoList and a task. Deleting a TodoList
will also cascade and delete all of its children tasks through a relationship.
The TodoList will have attributes name, tasks, and color. The Task will have
attributes name, date/time, weatherEnabled, orderIndex, and TodoList 
relationship.

Sketches and more detail for the app are provided in Proposal_Sketches.pdf
